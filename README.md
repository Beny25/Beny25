👋 Hey, I'm Beny

🚀 Passionate about exploring onchain experiments and building small but fun projects on Base.
Sometimes I break things, sometimes they actually work — either way, I learn something every day 😄

🧱 What I'm Building

- BanditBase.sol — an onchain message updater on Base
- Playing around with Hardhat + Node.js + PM2
- Automating things for fun (not bots, just vibes)

---

🌱 Currently Learning

- Smart contract architecture & onchain data flow
- How to make small dev projects more user-friendly
- GitHub Pages & Vercel for open web experiments
